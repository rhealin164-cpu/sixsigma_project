        "Rhodium is a powerful tool for analyzing and exploring a model. We demonstrated connecting Rhodium to the Lake Problem model written in Python. Rhodium also supports tools for connecting to models written natively (and compiled into a dynamically-linked library or shared object), Excel models, and more. Please visit our [GitHub page](https://github.com/Project-Platypus/Rhodium) to learn more, see the [examples](https://github.com/davidfgold/Rhodium/tree/master/examples) section for further demonstration of Rhodium."
